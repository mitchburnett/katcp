Notes
-----

This package provides the katcp library, several utilities and
a control server for the KAT 7 correlator, kcs. For the time
being kcs invokes the corr package (not included) to control
the correlator, but uses its own monitoring subsystem (fmon).

Build requirements
------------------

To build this you need GCC and GNU Make. Generally the code
doesn't contain that much GCC specific stuff (one or two 
__attribute__ ((packed)) statements), but the Makefiles do 
use GNU Make features.

Configuration
-------------

There is no configure script. If you wish to change some
build option (eg amount of debug information, floating
point support, version support) edit Makefile.inc. The various 
options are documented there.

Build
-----

Type 

  make 

at the top level directory. It is also possible to run make in
individual subdirectories. In that case build the content of the
katcp/ subdirectory first, as most other modules depend on it

Installation
------------

If you are only interested in the library (and maybe kcpcmd
or kcplog), enter the respective subdirectories and run make
install from there, eg

  make -C katcp install
  make -C cmd install

Only if you want to run the full KAT7 correlator run make
install at the top level, eg

  make install 

For this to be useful, you also require a configured corr
package, nfs server, dnsmasq, bof files, an exported ppc
filesystem not to mention 16 roach boards.
