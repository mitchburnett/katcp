This package contains a C katcp library implementation and selected applications using it. 
Unless otherwise noted the code base is released under the terms described in COPYING

The Makefile.inc file in this directory contains a number of options, edit to your needs


General purpose components

  katcp       - the katcp library itself
  cmd         - send arbitrary katcp commands to a remote server
  log         - a utility to monitor a remote katcp server
  sq          - simple katcp sensor query utility (block until 
                a sensor changes to a certain status field)
  examples    - simple examples 

Utilities for particular tasks, probably of lesser interest to most

  bulkread    - a utlity to perform a ?bulkread request
  msg         - something to generate katcp log messages (glue logic)
  par         - similar to cmd, but talk to multiple devices concurrently 

  tcpborphserver3 
              - roach2 server using memory mapped logic. Requires a kernel
                with a mmap driver and a roach2

  fmon        - fengine monitoring utility to poll gateware status registers (used by kcs)
  tmon        - monitor a local ntp server via katcp (used by kcs)
  scripts     - supporting logic to interface kcs to corr (used by kcs, temporary hack)
  kcs         - a control server using katcp (incomplete)

  wops        - incomplete (ignore)
