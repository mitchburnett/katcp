This is the programming utility which parses an .fpg file. It requires
tcpborphserver3 to do the actual programming

An fpg file consists of the following sections

  #!/bin/kcpfpg        - a header making it possible to execute an .fpg file
                         with chmod +x and the correct KATCP_SERVER variable
                         this permits remote programming 
  ?uploadbin           - boilerplate to trigger the bitstream upload      
  ?register            - register definitions: map a name to a memory region
  ... 
  ?meta                - other information describing the bistream
  ...
  ?quit                - an end of katcp messages marker
  <bitstream>          - the bitstream to be programmed into the fpga


The astute reader will notice that an .fpg file bears some resemblance 
a shar archive and also to a "frozen" http post request. Shoulders of 
giants 'n stuff

Also: It is quite possible to add extra things to this .fpg file, maybe even
tap-start requests, just note that you will have to edit the file in binary
mode (eg vim -b) lest your editor munges the binary parts of the bitstream
