kcprun is a wrapper for an arbitrary executable which will, by
default, 

  - rewrite messages to stdout as katcp info messages
  - rewrite messages to stderr as katcp error messages
  - terminate the process on encountering an eof on stdin

example use:

  $ kcprun ls 

  $ kcprun ls something-nonexistant
