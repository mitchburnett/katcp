    - complete kcs

      - state machine logic 

    - data path sensors. Not yet done. Could be done in
      two ways: Either on tcpborphserver, or polling 
      registers from kcs itself

********************************

  - add timestamp to client connect
  - maybe report disconnects too
  - improve center frequency selection 
  - searchable arb structures so that we can clear tgtaps on progdev
