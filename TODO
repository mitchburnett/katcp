    - complete kcs

      - state machine logic 

    - data path sensors. Not yet done. Could be done in
      two ways: Either on tcpborphserver, or polling 
      registers from kcs itself

********************************

  - add timestamp to client connect
  - maybe report disconnects too
  - improve center frequency selection 
  - searchable arb structures so that we can clear tgtaps on progdev



*** NEW DPX todos ***

 - device changed messages, particularly regarding sensors
 - device connected/disconnected messages
 - some default device-status handling
 - expand version-list, etc to also display build state, etc
 - parse #sensor-list, #sensor-status messages

 - either array type, or a way to print avl tree while honouring _LAST and first, maybe even both
